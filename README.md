Sentenzr is an application designed to help ESL students learn grammatical structures in a hands on way. It's inspired by the various interactive environments that I have used to learn coding syntax. The idea is for students to learn common patterns by playing around with the sentence controls. The logic is all contained in the sentence model and parts of the sentence can be changed out for others. After a change, the sentence updates to demonstrate the new structure.

Limitations
This first version is a bit limited. So far, it only works as an interactive conjugation table. All verbs and complements are treated exactly the same. So there is nothing to stop you from making sentences that don't make any sense.

Whats coming next?
The final goal is to have much more flexibility when building sentences. I want users to be able to construct noun phrases, preopositional phrases, adverbial clauses etc from scratch and combine these together to make more complicated sentences.

1. Word types - modules for special behaviour of different types of words.
2. Word categories - a way to organise words in logical groups
3. Search function - a quick way to find a word you're looking for
4. Spanish translations - pair up words with their translations in spanish.
